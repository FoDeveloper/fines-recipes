    <h1> Big Mac Bowl </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> A Hawaiian comfort-food classic, the Loco Moco has been one of my personal favorite meals in the past few months. The dish includes white rice, ground beef, a homemade gravy, and a nice fried egg on top. This is hearty, filling, and so damn good. If you're into SPAM (Not a big fan of the canned meats myself) definitely give a slice a sear and incorporate it into this Hawaiian Classic. </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 85 / 15 Ground Beef </li>
