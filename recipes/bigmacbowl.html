    <img src="../images/bigmacsaladbowls.jpg" alt = "Big Mac Salad Bowl" height="200" width="200">
    <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> A filling, protein packed dinner that reminds you of McDonald's iconic sandwich... The Big Mac.
            This dish provides almost all the enjoyment with no guilt, allowing you to reach fitness goals while enjoying a tasty meal.
            Pair this with a nice Diet Coke or Diet Lemonade and you'll be 2 in 2.
            All you need is some ground beef, shredded lettuce / cabbage, onions, cheese and seasonings, and we'll make our own high-protein Thousand Islands dressing. I promise you, you won't be able to taste the difference. </p>
